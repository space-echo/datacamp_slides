I take no credit for any of the slides contained in this repository. All the content came from the wonderful course creators at Datacamp. 

I'd encourage anyone who find these slides useful to try the courses out for yourself, that's where you'll get the most benefit.

I personally have had a Datacamp paid subscription for two years and have gotten a lot of benefit out of it in my career as a data scientist.
